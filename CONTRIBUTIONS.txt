Functionality: 

Tory: Worked on the story side. 
This includes parsing the story and formatting it in order to extract useful information for the potential answer phrases.
Also currently working on training the models in trainQA.py which will be incorporated later.

Rachel: Worked on the question side. 
This includes parsing the questions and formatting them in order to give each questions its classification.
Also worked on the Overlap and NER methods.

Aside from the trainQA.py which is from Tory, all the source code we are currently using is in qa.py.
The other "qa" files are our trial and errors. testrun.txt was for testing with the given file input format.
